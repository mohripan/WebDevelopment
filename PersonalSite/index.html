                <p><em>Founder and CTO of <strong>Rivest</strong>.</em></p>
                <p>Data Scientist and Machine Engineer responsible for building a model, model deployment, A/B testing, and analysing the data. I use Tableau to analyse data and usually use Pytorch to build a model and AWS Sage Maker to deploy a model. I have several years of experience for making machine learning model into production and using deep learning model to build an application. A very competitive person, I focused on the result to make this world a better world. I have won several competitions during my years of studying and I have a big ambition to be one of the most important people in this world.</p>
